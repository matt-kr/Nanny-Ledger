## App Store Description

**Nanny Ledger - Childcare Made Simple**

Say goodbye to scattered notes and forgotten hours! Nanny Ledger is the stress-free way to track childcare shifts, manage payments, and keep everything organized—all in one beautiful app.

**📅 Log Shifts in Seconds**
Tap "Log Today" and you're done. Smart defaults learn your schedule, so logging shifts is faster than making coffee.

**💜 Multi-Caregiver Ready**
Day nanny? Night nanny? Weekend babysitter? Track them all with separate profiles, rates, and schedules. No confusion, no mix-ups.

**💰 Stay on Top of Payments**
Generate professional receipts with a tap. Share payment notes via text. Know exactly what's owed, what's paid, and when.

**🎨 Beautiful & Intuitive**
We obsessed over every detail so you don't have to. Clean design, smooth animations, and that satisfying gradient you didn't know you needed.

**🔒 Your Data, Your Device**
Zero tracking. Zero ads. Zero servers. Everything stays on your device (or your personal iCloud). We literally can't see your data—and we like it that way.

**✨ The Good Stuff**
• Lightning-fast shift logging with smart defaults
• Multi-caregiver profiles with individual rates
• Weekly summaries with payment notes
• Professional PDF receipts
• Customizable schedules for each weekday
• Dark mode that actually looks good
• iCloud sync (optional)
• No subscription, no nonsense

**Who It's For:**
Parents juggling childcare schedules. Nannies tracking their hours. Anyone tired of sticky notes and mental math.

**Privacy First:**
No account required. No data collection. No analytics. Just you and your schedule.

Hey folks! Just launched Nanny Ledger - a childcare tracking app I built because my partner was drowning in sticky notes and calculator sessions.

SwiftUI + SwiftData + CloudKit. Multi-caregiver support, receipt generation with PDF export, and zero data collection (it's all local/iCloud).
